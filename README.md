# Trader-Behaviour-Insights
This analysis shows that higher trading activity during greed does not guarantee better profits, while fear periods encourage more disciplined and efficient trading. Market sentiment is therefore more effective as a risk-management signal than a trading signal.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes historical trader data alongside the Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index to understand how trader behavior aligns with market sentiment. The study examines profitability, trading volume, and risk-taking behavior under fear and greed conditions.

## Key Findings
- **Greed periods**: High trading activity and participation, but inconsistent profits.
- **Fear periods**: Disciplined trading with better risk-adjusted outcomes.
- **Insight**: Market sentiment is more useful as a **risk-management signal** than a direct trading indicator.
